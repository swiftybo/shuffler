# Shuffler

## 🚀 Overview
A web application built with React & CSS aimed at helping my friends and I quickly make decisions on "Movies To Watch", "Activities To Do", "Restaurants To Go" & "Recipes To Eat". Currently the only topic that is finished is the "Movie Shuffler"; other randomisers are in progress and will have their own features for example:
  - Activites Shuffler: use of SerpApi's "Google Events API" to suggest wildcard activites based on location and date.
  - Restaurants Shuffler: use of Leaflet to display a map which will show all the restaurants on the list and will allow the user to filter based on location & cuisine.
  - Recipe Shuffler: use of an API to find alternative recipes creating the same dish with different ingredients.

(Note: this shuffler has been based on a "Randomiser" which I previously created in Vanilla JS)

**Next Steps**: 
1. Deploy & add code to make the application layout correctly on smaller viewports (in partcular phone screens). This is likely with the use of CSS Media Queries.
2. Continue working on the next shuffler.
