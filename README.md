# Shuffler

This is the shuffler app used to help with indecision. Split into 4 categories, any group can get help on deciding which movie to watch; which restaurant to go to; which activity to do and/or what recipe to cook. Currently, the shuffler only acts as a MOVIE shuffler, with the functionality to shuffle other categories to come later. 

Used to solve a an actual problem between my partner and I as we are terrible at deciding what to do together.
